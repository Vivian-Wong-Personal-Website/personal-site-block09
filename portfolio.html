            <h2>Ogilvy Again Named A Leader In Gartner March 2020 Magic Quadrant For Global Marketing Agencies</h2>
            <img alt="portfolio" id="portfolio" src="./img/portfolio.jpeg"/>
            <p>Ogilvy, a global marketing and communications company, has been named a Leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Global
            Marketing Agencies report for the fifth consecutive year. Gartner, the worlds leading research and advisory company,
            evaluates vendors based on the ability to execute and for completeness of vision based on 15 distinct evaluation
            criteria.</p>
            <p>Leaders maintain a viable business, regardless of the global economy. Leaders extend their client relationships far
            beyond marketing promotions, often appearing on competitive bids outside their primary sector (for example, management
            consulting, product ideation and product development requests for quotations). Leaders help their clients develop
            digital marketing platforms designed for systemic growth and scale; they do so by harnessing their own significant
            expertise implementing digital marketing programs driven by data and analytics</p>
